# Predicting the price of Bulldozer using Machine Learning

- In this project I am predicting the sales price of the bulldozer using Random Forest Algorithm.
- The evaluation metric used for this analysis is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

### 

- The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers : https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

### Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Noteboo
